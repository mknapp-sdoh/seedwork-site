        <h1>The Seedwork Manifesto</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">For building software with Large Language Models</p>

        <p>Unlike the software development paradigms that preceded it, building software with Large Language Models is not construction. It is cultivation.</p>

        <p><strong>Values:</strong></p>

        <ul class="values">
            <li><strong>Emergent capabilities</strong> over specified requirements</li>
            <li><strong>Cultivation</strong> over construction</li>
            <li><strong>Discovery through use</strong> over upfront design</li>
            <li><strong>Native strengths</strong> over forced behaviors</li>
        </ul>

        <p>That is, while the items on the right have value, the items on the left matter more.</p>

        <h2>Principles behind the Seedwork Manifesto</h2>

        <p><strong>1.</strong> The highest priority is to discover and cultivate the unexpected value that emerges when AI meets real problems.</p>

        <p><strong>2.</strong> Welcome non-determinism as a feature, not a bug. The same prompt yielding different responses is what makes the system valuable.</p>

        <p><strong>3.</strong> Ship to real users early and often. Emergent capabilities cannot be discovered in a sandbox.</p>

        <p><strong>4.</strong> The most powerful applications emerge when working with the grain of what language models naturally do well, not against it.</p>

        <p><strong>5.</strong> Build the minimum scaffolding necessary. The intelligence is in the model; the job is to connect it to context and action.</p>

        <p><strong>6.</strong> Prompts are conversations, not specifications. They evolve through dialogue with the system, not upfront design.</p>

        <p><strong>7.</strong> Discovery is the primary measure of progress. "It also does this" is more valuable than "it does exactly what was specified."</p>

        <p><strong>8.</strong> Trust the model's latent capabilities. The potential exists before finding it—the work is exploration, not creation.</p>

        <p><strong>9.</strong> Evaluate outcomes in context, not against fixed metrics. Success often looks different than expected.</p>

        <p><strong>10.</strong> Simplicity is essential. Remove code between the model and the problem.</p>

        <p><strong>11.</strong> The best AI applications emerge from rapid experimentation, real-world feedback, and willingness to be surprised.</p>

        <p><strong>12.</strong> At regular intervals, ask: "What is this system doing that wasn't planned for?" Then cultivate the valuable surprises and prune the rest.</p>

        <h2>Why "Seedwork"</h2>

        <p>A seed contains latent potential. A plant is not built—conditions for growth are provided. Native species thrive in their environment when worked with, not against. What emerges has a life of its own.</p>

        <p>Large language models are similar. The capabilities exist in the weights before a line of code is written. The work is cultivation: providing the right context, the right tools, the right connection to real problems. And like gardening, there must be willingness to be surprised by what grows.</p>

        <p>Seedwork replaces the construction metaphor (building, architecting, engineering) with a cultivation metaphor (planting, nurturing, discovering, pruning).</p>

        <h2>What Seedwork Means in Practice</h2>

        <div class="contrast">
            <p><strong>Instead of:</strong> Writing detailed specifications for AI behavior</p>
            <p><strong>Try:</strong> Quick experiments to discover what the model naturally does well</p>
        </div>

        <div class="contrast">
            <p><strong>Instead of:</strong> Extensive upfront prompt engineering</p>
            <p><strong>Try:</strong> Shipping early and evolving prompts through real-world feedback</p>
        </div>

        <div class="contrast">
            <p><strong>Instead of:</strong> Treating unexpected outputs as bugs</p>
            <p><strong>Try:</strong> Asking "Is this actually valuable?" before calling it a problem</p>
        </div>

        <div class="contrast">
            <p><strong>Instead of:</strong> Measuring success against predetermined metrics</p>
            <p><strong>Try:</strong> Watching for emergent value and updating the definition of success</p>
        </div>

        <div class="contrast">
            <p><strong>Instead of:</strong> Building complex orchestration around AI</p>
            <p><strong>Try:</strong> Minimal scaffolding that connects the model to real context and real action</p>
