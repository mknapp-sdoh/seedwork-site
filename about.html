        <h2>Seedwork</h2>

        <p>Seedwork is a methodology for building software with Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems with emergent capabilities that do things you didn't explicitly program.</p>

        <p>The name comes from the observation that working with LLMs is more like gardening than construction. Capabilities aren't built; conditions for them to emerge are cultivated. The potential exists in the model before a line of code is written.</p>

        <p>The Seedwork Manifesto was written by Michael Knapp in collaboration with Claude (Anthropic) in December 2024. The ideas behind Seedwork were shaped by many conversations with software engineer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bentucker/">Ben Tucker</a>.</p>

        <h2>Michael Knapp</h2>

        <p>Michael Knapp builds technology for mission-driven organizations. He has spent the past year exploring how AI can create value for nonprofits and social enterprises—and learning that the most valuable outcomes are often the ones you didn't plan for.</p>

        <p>Michael is founder of <a href="https://sdoh.org">sdoh.org</a> and <a href="https://beyondhate.com">beyondhate.com</a>. He recently joined the board of Native Plant Trust, which seemed relevant.</p>
